After the Storm
===============

**After the Storm** (**AtS**) is an add-on campaign for the
**[Battle for Wesnoth][1]**.

[1]: <https://www.wesnoth.org/>

This campaign is the immediate sequel to *Invasion from the Unknown*.

After the Emperor of Chaos was defeated, the free civilizations of the
Great Continent hoped that his followers would abandon the ongoing war.
Meanwhile, Galas and his unlikely band of heroes head back to the northern
lands to request aid for their next journey.

Later, the Chaos Empire still manages to make a stand against its enemies.
While the Grand Council is preoccupied with more pressing matters, the fragile
alliance of the peoples of the Far North is threatened by a new, mysterious
leader who seeks to invade their defenseless lands.

**(Intermediate level, three separate episodes with 13 scenarios each.)**

**NOTE:** Some scenarios of this campaign work significantly different from
normal Wesnoth gameplay. It is especially important to pay close attention to
the mission objectives and not necessarily try to kill every single enemy,
especially on shrouded maps, or in places where enemies seem to respawn
continuously.

Although not strictly required, players are advised to become familiar with the
stories, characters, and historical events presented in *Descent into Darkness*,
*Under the Burning Suns*, and especially *Invasion from the Unknown* before
playing this campaign.


Installing After the Storm
--------------------------

Requirements:
 * Battle for Wesnoth 1.16.x (development versions 1.15.14 through 1.15.18 may
   also work).
 * *After the Storm Music* and *Invasion from the Unknown Music* add-ons from
   the Wesnoth add-ons server (optional, include additional music used
   throughout the campaign).

Released versions of AtS should be obtained from the Battle for Wesnoth add-ons
server using the game’s built-in client. Alternatively, players who know how to
use Git may clone the [main repository][2] on GitHub into Wesnoth’s
`<user data>/data/add-ons` directory. See [Where is my user data directory?][3]
in the Wesnoth.org wiki for information on locating your user data directory.

For using the Git version, you will also need to install [Naia][4] into
`<user data>/data/add-ons`, or into `<user data>/data/add-ons/After_the_Storm`
so that there is a `Naia` directory in either location. The version of Naia
installed directly to the add-ons directory will override any found inside the
campaign’s own directory.

Some sequences make use of floating labels, halos, and standing unit
animations, so you might want to make sure these options are enabled under
**Preferences** → **Display**.


Reporting issues
----------------

If you encounter any issues, you may report them at the campaign’s
[development topic][5] on the Wesnoth.org forums or its [issue tracker][6] on
GitHub.
