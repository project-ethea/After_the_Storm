    description= _ "It is not usual for an Imp to grow much above the size they had when born, nor to acquire intellect, in any sense. However, the unusual happens, and then it is possible for some of them to grow stronger and smarter in their attacks, to the point that they, instead of being cannon-fodder or suicidal attack force of demons, get to lead small groups of them, not having any armor or weapons other than their natural toughness and brute strength. As they delight in tearing their prey to pieces, they have been titled the ‘Gutwrenchers’ by those who have survived the horrendous event.

With time, they have developed a new dreadful attack weapon: acid slime, which can melt a human, or even orc, in matter of seconds. They spit it towards they victim, wait until it has consumed most of its body, and then finish the job swallowing the remaining flesh and bones. Worse than worse, they can now drain vital energy from their victims at close contact.

Fortunately, abominations such as these are rarely seen in greater numbers. It is also said that there are Imps bigger than a full-grown Troll, but the rumors have not been confirmed... yet."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DRAIN}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_POISON}
