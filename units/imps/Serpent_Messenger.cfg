    description= _ "Legend tells of the mighty serpent god who defied Uria and was shortly defeated by her. In order to set an example for other demon lords who could consider defying or betraying her, his soul was sealed into stone. His followers—once worshipers of the power of light—were turned to the darkness and changed into wretched creatures charged with the mission of spreading fear and panic to dishearten her victims.

Regardless of the veracity of their origins, they can be quite effective against lesser creatures and the weak-willed, whereas brave and experienced warriors find them to be little more than a nuisance on the battlefield."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_TERROR}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DRAIN}
