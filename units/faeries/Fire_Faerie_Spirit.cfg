    description= _ "One of the greatest mysteries of life is the true nature of Faerie, a domain of existence beyond the grasp of mortal creatures and the source of a power said to predate Irdyaâ€™s creation by an immensurable eternity. Even though elves and faeries have an innate affinity to the mystical energy within, their ability to channel it is severely constrained by their attachment to the physical realm. Breaking free of those bindings and fully embracing the arcane flame is not without its drawbacks, however.

These faerie phantasms are occasionally seen aimlessly wandering the forests during the twilight. Their warped minds are no longer able to discern our reality from theirs, and only gradually fading memories keep them anchored to the domain of the living."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SPIRIT}
