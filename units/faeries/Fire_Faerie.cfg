    description= _ "Forest faeries rarely take part in wars and conflicts, preferring instead to dance and frolic in their forest homes. They will, however, defend these to the death; to this end, the forest elves have proven allies of convenience. The elves themselves have long had respect for those with a close affinity with the Arcane Flame. It is due to this close relationship that faeries will sometimes be found by the elvesâ€™ side in times of great need.

The more experienced faeries possess an even greater mastery of the fire element, allowing them to hurl balls of raging fire at their enemies, or to ignite them with a single touch. Some are even said to eventually burn away their corporeal forms entirely, becoming a spirit born of the rage of the Flame."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
