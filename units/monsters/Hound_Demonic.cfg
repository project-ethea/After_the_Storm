Aside from the involved removal of their souls and the increased bodily strength, demonic hounds acquire a more developed intellect, which turns them into more perilous foes who will not stop at anything but the accomplishment of their purpose and desire of bloodbath."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_BERSERK}
