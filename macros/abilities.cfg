# GENERAL NOTE ABOUT ASPECT ABILITIES:
#
# These abilities are only appropriate for actual guardians, of which there
# are only three on Irdya before the campaign is over, and none left
# afterwards. You should not really be reusing these abilities for any other
# units.
#
# More generally, aspect guardians stick to the "new powers as the plot
# demands" trope, and the full extent of their powers is intentionally not
# explored in this campaign. Young/recently awakened guardians in particular
# do not have access to their full potential yet.
