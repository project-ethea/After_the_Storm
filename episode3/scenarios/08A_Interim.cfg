His influence might have brought her kind the boon of a more physical existence in greater numbers, albeit losing their immortality in the process.

Just like Darkness precedes and succeeds Light from a physical standpoint, it also deals with matters of the mind, whereas Light deals with the soul of every being born under the Tree of Life. However, just as both aspects complement each other, they may also exchange places according to the circumstances.

Merthiaal, the Guardian of Darkness on Yrathid, was the last guardian to be born during the First Cycle, and at the same time, she was the first guardian to perish. Although Yaraeâ€™s conflict had not yet begun, he did have an indirect role in causing Merthiaalâ€™s downfall. The young guardianâ€™s emotions clouded her reason; jealousy consumed her heart from inside as she watched her creatorâ€™s predilection for her sisters Uria and Xiaâ€™el.

In a desperate attempt to prove her worth to Yarae and even surpass his own power, the girl subverted her worldâ€™s seed and tried to absorb its energy for herself. Alas, even though their blood was always one and the same, the guardian and the Seed of Darkness were never meant to become one."

Instead of becoming the true goddess she desired to be, the very aspect she controlled was destroyed â€” her mind succumbed to insanity as her horrifying new body absorbed the souls of each and every one of her fellow Yrathidians.

Uria put an end to Merthiaalâ€™s rampage by ripping her heart out, destroying her body, and sealing her self in the hope that Yarae could do something to remedy the situation. However, Yarae was offended by the proposition; he refused to help with the resurrection and healing, choosing instead to preserve the lifeless world intact as a testament to his childâ€™s hubris.

That incarnation of Uria would never be able to bring Merthiaal back to life, and the Guardian of Darkness would come to be known as the Eater of Souls, the antithesis of the Guardian of Light. Now lacking a distinct seed, Yrathid would not be restored at the end of the First Cycle, remaining instead a graveyard world per Yaraeâ€™s wishes."

The technology that binds your body and soul with Merthiaalâ€™s heart was considered highly experimental on its world of origin, and every test subject was destroyed without exception.

Maybe it was because the heart they chose for their testing was that of an unborn goddess as opposed to a deceased one. Maybe it was because the Aspect of Fire itself did not choose them. Or maybe those individuals simply lacked the resolve, and the initial excruciating pain was too much for their feeble psyches.

If you were to use Golden Age literature as reference, you would say he always regarded you as a daughter. His increasing lack of empathy did not allow him to see that you had feelings of a different kind for him. While that truly bothered you in the beginning, you would soon learn of another cost of being a guardian. To put it into perspective, of all the guardians that have lived so far, only the second incarnation of the Guardian of Fire found true love â€” and then she died under mysterious circumstances.

Those unrequited feelings of yours vanished long ago, but that does not change the fact that you owe your life to Argan and that you will do everything within your power for him, even now that he is gone for good."
