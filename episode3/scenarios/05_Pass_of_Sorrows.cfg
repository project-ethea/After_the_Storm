They gave up much to get to this valley: their lives, their families... Most of them died along the way. The few survivors found a ruined temple amidst the mountains, probably built by an extinct civilization. From that temple they learned the ways of fire magic, and the song of Shardia, She who forged knowledge from the fire of our hearts.

They thrived with their newfound skills and the protection granted by the precipitous mountain range. They continued to learn from Her, and longed for the day when She would come to this earth and bless it with Her song. And in time, so did we.

He spoke a message from the so-called Goddess of Life from beyond the Void, Uria, who had tasked him with the mission of spreading her voice to all non-believers in this land. But other than the Goddess who gave us our fire magic, we would worship no-one, especially not someone who only communicated through an embodiment of the unnatural like that dark prophet. And so we dismissed his words as the blasphemous ramblings of a barbarian.

In time, we would be proven wrong.")}

That is to say, <b>I</b> was offered that last chance.

Everyone was slaughtered. Everyone except me, my brother, and a child with beautiful hair, whom we believed was the heiress of Her fire; for never before we saw one of our own be born with the same hair color as our Goddess. But just like the scrolls and books we hoarded, we eventually lost her to the walking vultures of the desert, who took her as their own. They spared her life, seeing as she was but a child, but our own fate was vastly different.")}

The light of the suns we once revered became a scorching enemy by day. Our fire magic was quickly displaced by shadow magic as we could no longer even withstand the heat of our flames. We had too become embodiments of corruption, a mockery of the beings we once were.

We vowed to take revenge upon the dark courier who brought disgrace upon our kind, and anyone who was ever close to him or his followers. Either we would be destroyed and released from our prison, or our curse would be extended to the creatures we abhorred.
