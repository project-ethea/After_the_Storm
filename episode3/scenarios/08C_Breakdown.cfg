Evidence indicates the number of Energy Hearts a guardian may have varies, possibly in relation with their corresponding aspect. It is known that the first incarnation of Uria had four such interconnected organs, whereas the first incarnation of Valdir had only two. Most other guardians during the First Cycle had only one.

Norsulan studies recently conducted on the late Guardian of Fire of the Second Cycle indicate that she only had one Energy Heart. Earlier studies conducted on her seed showed that it is possible to artificially grow the organ in non-Guardians, albeit with disastrous effects. An alternative approach was used to build the first prototype of an artificial Guardian, keeping the Energy Heart in a separate insulated container with a direct pathway to the host’s nervous system, and an electronic control unit.")}
